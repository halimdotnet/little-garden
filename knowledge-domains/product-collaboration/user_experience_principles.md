# User Experience Principles

### 1. Jakob's Law 

_"Users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know."_

**Key Principles**:
- **Mental Model Alignment**: Users form mental models based on their previous digital experiences. These models inform how they expect interfaces to work. When interfaces align with existing mental models, users can immediately be productive rather than first having to learn a new system.
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: By leveraging familiar patterns, users expend less mental energy figuring out how to use an interface. The less cognitive effort spent learning an interface, the more mental resources users can dedicate to achieving their actual goals.
- **Strategic Convention Usage**: The law encourages following common design conventions in critical areas such as page structure, workflows, navigation, and placement of expected elements (like search functionality).

While advocating for familiar patterns, Jakob's Law doesn't prohibit innovation. Rather, it suggests designers should have compelling reasons when departing from conventions, and should test thoroughly when doing so.

### 2. Doherty Threshold
_"Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400 ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other."_

The threshold represents the critical point at which human-computer interaction becomes seamless enough that the interaction itself becomes nearly invisible, allowing users to maintain their focus on their tasks rather than on waiting for the system to respond. This principle establishes system performance and response time not merely as technical considerations but as essential design features that directly affect user experience, engagement, and productivity.

**Key Principles**:
- **Response Time-Productivity Relationship**: Productivity increases disproportionately as response times decrease below the 400 ms threshold, creating exponential rather than linear improvements in efficiency and user satisfaction.
- **Attention Retention**: System responses within 100-300 ms feel nearly instantaneous to users, maintaining their engagement and focus on the task. Delays beyond this range begin to break the flow of concentration, with attention starting to wander after 1 second, and users mentally shifting to other tasks after 10 seconds.
- **Cognitive Load Impact**: Slower response times increase cognitive load as users must maintain task-relevant information in working memory for longer periods, reducing their overall cognitive capacity for the primary task.
- **Response Time Expectations**: Users form mental models of how quickly specific processes should complete based on their complexity, and violations of these expectations (either too slow or too fast) can create negative impressions.

### 3. Hick's Law
_"The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available."_

This principle is fundamental to understanding how cognitive load affects user decision-making processes and interaction efficiency in digital interfaces.

**Key Principles**:
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Every interface element requires mental processing power. When the amount of information exceeds available cognitive capacity, users experience mental overload, leading to decreased performance, missed details, and feelings of frustration. Effective designs minimize unnecessary cognitive burden.
- **Working Memory Limitations**: Users have limited working memoryâ€”the mental "buffer space" for processing immediate information. When interfaces demand more memory than available, critical information may be lost, tasks become more difficult, and users may abandon their goals entirely.
- **Decision Time Correlation**: The time required to make a decision logarithmically increases with the number of options available. This means that while adding options does increase decision time, the impact of each additional option diminishes as the total number grows.
