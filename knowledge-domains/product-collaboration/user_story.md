# User Story

## A. User Stories
A user story is a planning tool that serves as a promissory note for future conversation between team members. Stories are brief, customer-centric descriptions of functionality that represent work customers recognize and value, rather than implementation details.

### 1. Characteristics
User stories possess two essential characteristics:
- **Customer Value Representation**: Stories describe work that provides value to customers, users, or business stakeholders, using terminology that customers understand and can prioritize effectively.
- **Clear Completion Criteria**: Stories must have well-defined conditions that indicate when the work is considered "done," enabling on-site customers to make informed decisions about completion.

### 2. Attributes
Six essential attributes that define good stories and ensure they are useful for both planning and development:

- **Independent** - A good story should stand on its own and not be dependent on other stories. Dependencies create prioritization and estimation problems.
- **Negotiable** - Stories are not fixed contracts, they are flexible and meant to be discussed and refined through conversation between customers and developers.
- **Valuable** - Every story must deliver value either to the end user or the purchaser of the system.
- **Estimatable** - Stories must be clear enough for developers to estimate the effort required.
- **Small** - Stories should be small enough to be completed within a short timeframe, typically from half a day to two weeks of work.
- **Testable** - A story must be written in a way that allows it to be tested. If it cannot be tested, the team cannot determine when it is finished.
