# Logical Fallacy

## Definition

A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning that makes an argument invalid or weak. On the surface, the argument may look persuasive, but when you analyze it carefully, the reasoning is flawed.

Think of it like a “trap in thinking” — the logic seems correct, but it actually doesn’t follow sound principles.

## Common Types of Logical Fallacies

### 1. Ad Hominem (Attack the Person)
- **Definition:** Rejecting an idea or argument by attacking the character, role, or competence of the person making it rather than addressing the actual point.
- **Tips:** Always separate the argument from the person. Critique the reasoning, not the individual.
- **Example:** “We can ignore Alex’s proposal to refactor the service; he’s a junior engineer who doesn’t understand large-scale systems.”

### 2. Strawman
- **Definition:** Misrepresenting someone’s argument into a weaker or exaggerated version, then attacking that instead.
- **Tips:** When debating solutions, restate the other person’s idea fairly before critiquing. Ask, “Did I capture your idea correctly?”
- **Example:**
    - Engineer A: “We should consider breaking the monolith gradually.”
    - Engineer B: “So you’re saying we should stop all feature delivery for months?”

### 3. False Dilemma (Black-or-White Thinking)
- **Definition:** Presenting only two extreme options when multiple alternatives exist.
- **Tips:** Look for “either/or” framing and challenge it by asking, “What other options could exist?”
- **Example:** Either we adopt Kubernetes now, or we’ll never be able to scale this company.

### 4. Appeal to Authority
- **Definition:** Assuming an idea is correct just because an authority figure or external source supports it.
- **Tips:** Use expert opinions as input, not proof. Ask for evidence and data, not just reputation.
- **Example:** We should use this architecture because a well-known CTO recommended it in a podcast.

### 5. Slippery Slope
- **Definition:** Arguing that a small first step will inevitably lead to a dramatic negative outcome.
- **Tips:** Ask for evidence of the chain reaction. Distinguish between possibility and inevitability.
- **Example:** If we allow one exception to our coding standard, soon no one will follow any standards, and our entire codebase will be chaos.

### 6. Circular Reasoning
- **Definition:** The argument assumes the truth of what it’s trying to prove, making it self-referential.
- **Tips:** Watch for conclusions that simply restate the premise in different words.
- **Example:** This process is the best because it’s better than all other processes.

### 7. Hasty Generalization
- **Definition:** Drawing a broad conclusion based on too little evidence.
- **Tips:** Check if the claim is based on enough representative data. Avoid overgeneralizing from one or two cases.
- **Example:** Last quarter, two projects failed after using microservices. Therefore, microservices don’t work for our company.

### 8. Red Herring
- **Definition:** Introducing an irrelevant point to distract from the main issue.
- **Tips:** Refocus on the core problem by asking, “How does this relate to our current decision?”
- **Example:** We’re discussing why the release failed, but instead let’s talk about how great the new office space is.

### 9. Bandwagon Fallacy
- **Definition:** Believing something is correct or best just because many others are doing it.
- **Tips:** Trends can be informative, but decisions need to be tied to context and data.
- **Example:** All the top startups are using GraphQL, so we must migrate to it immediately.

### 10. Post Hoc (False Cause)
- **Definition:** Assuming that because one event followed another, the first caused the second.
- **Tips:** Correlation ≠ causation. Look for other contributing factors.
- **Example:** We introduced daily stand-ups, and productivity increased. Therefore, stand-ups caused the improvement.
