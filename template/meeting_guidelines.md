# Meeting Guidelines

## Guidelines

### 1. Agenda Submission Deadline and Format

Meeting participants must submit clear, concise agenda items with relevant details, including the topic, purpose, and any necessary background information, [48 hours] before the meeting to allow for ample review and preparation. A standardized template, if available, should be used.

### 2.  Meeting Preparation

Participants are expected to thoroughly prepare for the meeting. This includes reviewing relevant documents, conducting research, and being ready to contribute to discussions and decisions.

### 3. Decision-Making Focus

The primary purpose of the meeting is to make decisions. Discussions should be goal-oriented and aimed at reaching conclusions or taking action. Avoid tangential topics that do not contribute to the meeting's objectives.

### 4. Respect for Time, Moderation and Time Management

Begin and conclude the meeting promptly to respect everyone's time. Appoint a facilitator to maintain discussion focus, set time limits for agenda items, and adhere to them to manage the meeting efficiently.

### 5. Participation Expectations, Stay on Topic

Participants must actively engage, encourage open dialogue, and stick to agenda items. Off-topic discussions should be deferred to future meetings to maintain focus.

### 6. Conflict Resolution

If conflicts or disagreements arise during discussions, they should be addressed respectfully and constructively. Focus on finding solutions rather than assigning blame.

### 7. Follow-Up Actions

Clearly document the decisions made during the meeting, along with any action items and responsibilities. Distribute meeting minutes promptly after the meeting concludes.

### 8. Feedback and Improvement

Encourage participants to provide feedback on the meeting's effectiveness and suggest improvements. Regularly review meeting processes to enhance efficiency and productivity.
