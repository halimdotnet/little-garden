# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## A. Detailed ADR Structure

### 1. Title
The title of an ADR serves as both an identifier and a concise summary of the decision.

- **Descriptive and specific** - Clearly indicates what the decision addresses
- **Concise** - Brief enough to be quickly understood
- **Action-oriented** - Often starts with a verb like "Use," "Adopt," "Implement," or "Standardize"
- **Numbered** - Typically includes a sequential number for easy reference

### 2. Status
The status field indicates where the decision is in its lifecycle, providing important context about its validity and applicability.

- **Proposed** - The decision is being considered but has not been formally accepted. It's under review and discussion.
- **Accepted** - The decision has been approved and is currently in effect. The team is expected to comply with this decision.
- **Deprecated** - The decision is still valid and in effect, but it's planned to be phased out or replaced in the future. This status helps teams prepare for upcoming changes.
- **Superseded** - The decision has been replaced by a newer decision. This status includes a reference to the ADR that replaces it, providing continuity in documentation.
- **Rejected** - The decision was considered but not approved for implementation. Including rejected decisions provides valuable context about alternatives considered and why they were not chosen.

### 3. Context
The context section is arguably the most crucial part of an ADR as it explains the "why" behind a decision. This section should thoroughly describe the situation that necessitated the decision.

- **Problem statement** - Clear articulation of the issue being addressed
- **Business drivers** - Business requirements, goals, or constraints that influence the decision
- **Technical constraints** - Limitations in technology, infrastructure, or existing systems
- **Architecture characteristics** - Relevant characteristics like scalability, performance, or security that must be considered
- **External factors** - Regulatory requirements, market conditions, or organizational factors
- **Current state** - Description of the existing situation or implementation
  Stakeholder concerns - Different perspectives and requirements from key stakeholders

### 4. Decision
The decision section provides a clear statement of what was decided. This section should be unambiguous, leaving no room for interpretation about what was chosen.

- **Clear and direct** - Stated plainly without ambiguity
- **Specific** - Includes details necessary for implementation
- **Positive** framing - States what will be done, not what won't be done
- **Actionable** - Provides enough information for teams to act upon
- **Focused** - Addresses one decision per ADR (complex decisions may be split into multiple ADRs)

### 5. Consequences
The consequences section analyses the impacts of the decision, both positive and negative. This sectionâ€”acknowledging trade-offs is essential for a complete understanding of the decision.

- **Positive consequences** - Benefits and advantages expected from the decision
- **Negative consequences** - Drawbacks, limitations, or new challenges introduced
- **Risks** - Potential issues that might arise and their mitigation strategies
- **Trade-offs** - What was gained versus what was sacrificed
- **Resource implications** - Impact on cost, time, or human resources
- **Future considerations** - How the decision might affect future options or decisions
- **Impact on architecture characteristics** - How key characteristics like performance, scalability, or maintainability are affected

### 6. Compliance (Optional)
The compliance section, while optional, provides valuable information about how adherence to the decision will be ensured and measured.

- **Measurement criteria** - How compliance will be quantified or measured
- **Verification methods** - How compliance will be checked or validated
- **Enforcement mechanisms** - Tools, processes, or procedures to ensure compliance
- **Exceptions process** - How to request and document variances when needed
- **Responsibility assignment** - Who is responsible for ensuring compliance

### 7. Notes (Optional)
The notes section provides space for additional information that doesn't fit neatly into the other categories but is still valuable for understanding the decision in context.

- **References** - Links to relevant documents, articles, or resources
- **Historical information** - Background that influenced the decision
- **Meeting notes** - Summaries of discussions related to the decision
- **Alternative options** - More detailed description of alternatives considered
- **Participants** - People involved in making the decision
- **Implementation guidance** - Additional tips or guidelines for implementation
- **Related decisions** - References to other ADRs that relate to this one
- **Future considerations** - Potential future changes or evolution of the decision

## B. Example

### ADR 003: Adopt PostgreSQL as Primary Database
**Status**: Superseded by ADR 008 (Use GraphQL for API Queries) on 2024-05-25

### 1. Context
Our application needs to store structured data with complex relationships and support transactions. The data volume is expected to grow to approximately 10TB over the next three years with an estimated 1,000 concurrent users at peak times.

Key requirements include:
- Support for ACID transactions
- High availability (99.99% uptime)
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Ability to handle complex queries and reporting
- Integration with our existing data analysis tools

The operations team has expertise in PostgreSQL and MySQL but limited experience with NoSQL solutions. The development team primarily works with Java and Spring Framework.

Cost is a concern as we have limited budget for database licensing, but performance and reliability are prioritized over cost considerations.

### 2. Decision

We will adopt PostgreSQL 13 as our primary relational database management system. All application data will be stored in PostgreSQL databases, which will be deployed in a primary-replica configuration with two replica nodes for high availability.

We will use the PostgreSQL native replication features along with pgpool-II for connection pooling and load balancing. Backups will be performed using pg_dump with incremental backups every 6 hours and full backups daily.

All database access will be through our application's data access layer using Hibernate ORM with appropriate connection pooling.

### 3. Consequences

Positive:
- PostgreSQL provides robust transaction support and data integrity required by our application
- The team's existing expertise will reduce implementation and operational risks
- Built-in replication features support our high availability requirements
- No licensing costs align with our budget constraints
- Rich ecosystem of tools and extensions provides flexibility for future needs
- Strong community support ensures timely security updates and patches

Negative:
- Horizontal scaling is more complex compared to some NoSQL alternatives
- Performance at very high data volumes (>50TB) may require additional strategies
- Requires dedicated database administration skills for optimal performance
- Some advanced features may require additional extensions or custom development

Trade-offs:
- We accept potentially more complex scaling strategies in exchange for stronger data consistency
- We prioritize reliability and team familiarity over potentially better performance with specialized databases
- We choose a general-purpose solution over domain-specific optimizations

This decision will require us to invest in database optimization skills within the team and develop a clear strategy for database partitioning as we approach scaling limits.

### 4. Compliance

Compliance with this decision will be verified through:
1. Automated checks in the CI/CD pipeline that validate all database connections are routed through the approved data access layer
2. Architecture review during pull request approval process
3. Quarterly database usage audits by the platform team

Exceptions to this decision require approval from both the Chief Architect and the Head of Infrastructure, documented in the project's exception register.

The Database Guild is responsible for monitoring compliance and reporting any issues to the Architecture Review Board.

- Performance benchmarking results (https://example.org/db-benchmarks)
- Cost analysis spreadsheet (internal document: DB-COST-ANALYSIS.xlsx)

This decision was reached after three architecture workshops (May 01, 21, and 22, 2023) with participation from the development team, operations, and business stakeholders. Key participants included: Jane Smith (Lead Architect), Mark Johnson (Database Administrator), Lisa Wong (Development Team Lead), and Robert Garcia (Operations Manager).

We considered MongoDB and MySQL as alternatives:
- MongoDB would offer better horizontal scaling but wouldn't meet our ACID transaction requirements without significant custom development
- MySQL would meet most requirements but our team has more experience with PostgreSQL, and benchmark tests showed PostgreSQL performing 15% better for our specific query patterns

Implementation Notes:
- Development team should attend the PostgreSQL Advanced Features training in Q3
- Operations team will create a detailed database backup and recovery plan by August 15
- Initial schema design review scheduled for July 10
